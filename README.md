## Hey there 👋

I build things for fun and also for work sometimes. I'm usually available for freelance work with React, Next.js, Laravel, Livewire, and/or Tailwind CSS. Currently working as a sessional academic & exploring a few post-grad options.

Currently vibing the VLIRT stack (Vite, Laravel, Inertia, React, & Tailwind)<br />
Somewhat ok at C, C#, Python, Rust, & Matlab.

More coming soon :))
